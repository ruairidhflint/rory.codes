Last year was a profound journey of contrasts for me, marked by the loss of my father and the arrival of my first child, all within the span of seven months. These events have reshaped my understanding of life, work, and the delicate balance we all strive to maintain between personal fulfilment and professional ambition.

The passing of my father was a profound loss that reverberated through the core of my being, leaving an indelible mark on my soul. He was not just a parent but a guiding force in my life. His wisdom, shared through stories and advice and which he would always play down, had been a constant source of strength for me. His passing left a void, not only in my heart but in my daily routine. Suddenly, the person I turned to for advice, the one who had always been there to offer perspective on career decisions and personal challenges, was gone. This loss made me reevaluate my priorities, questioning the path I was on and whether it aligned with the values and lessons he had imparted.

Then, as I was grappling with this grief, my child was born, turning my world upside down in a completely different way. The joy and responsibility of becoming a parent brought a new set of challenges and priorities to my life. Suddenly, my career and personal ambitions were no longer just about me; they were about providing for my family and setting an example for my child, just as my father had done for me.

These two life-changing events have had a profound effect on my career and other areas of my life. Navigating grief while embracing the new responsibilities of parenthood has been a delicate balancing act. I've found myself reassessing my career goals, striving to find work that is not only fulfilling but also allows me to spend quality time with my family. The importance of work-life balance has never been clearer to me. I want to succeed professionally, but not at the expense of missing out on my child's milestones or neglecting my own well-being.

These experiences have taught me the importance of resilience and adaptability. I've learned to adjust my expectations and goals in light of these new circumstances. I've become more focused on what truly matters – building a secure and happy future for my family, while also honouring my father's memory by living up to the values he taught me.

The loss of my father and the birth of my child have reshaped my perspective on career and life. These events have underscored the importance of aligning my professional aspirations with my personal values and responsibilities. They've reminded me that success is not just measured by career achievements but by the impact we have on the lives of those we love and the legacy we leave behind.

You will have undoubtedly heard the advice before: hold the ones you love close, make time for them, listen to them and love. But truly I implore you, really do it. My son is growing up fast and is from the boy he was just a few weeks ago. Waste no time for you never know how much there is left.
