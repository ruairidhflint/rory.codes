Small things I forget. Things I need to remind myself once in a while. Things I would tell myself to remember if I could go back in time and talk to the younger me.

- It only takes a [couple of days](/july-2024/) to completely reset your diet and fitness routine. Donâ€™t worry about the long term results, just get two days under your belt and the rest is easy.
- You always feel better when you take care of your appearance and make an effort to dress a little sharper,
- Double down. On everything.
- Get a haircut more often than you think you need one.
- Don't skimp on your desk chair, headphones, or shoes.
- Do not be a victim. Especially in your own mind.
- Spend more money on meals and gifts for those you love.
- Avoid sugar at all costs.
- The baby will _sleep_. Don't worry about it.
- Listen more than you [speak](/talking-or-speaking/).
