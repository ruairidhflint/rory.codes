Hello! My name is Rory, I'm a software engineer from London, England. I studied Full Stack Web Development at
<a href="https://lambdaschool.com/" target="_blank">Lambda School</a> after several years working as a commercial
photographer.

Currently I work at <a href="https://tipalti.com/" target="_blank">Tipalti</a> , building mobile experiences on Android and iOS. Previously I led technology at <a href="https://cpandr.co.uk/" target="_blank">CP+R</a>, a cardiac rehabilitation specialist.

Beyond work I read voraciously, build plenty of side projects and try to live a full life away from all things digital.

Here's what I'm doing [now](/now/).
